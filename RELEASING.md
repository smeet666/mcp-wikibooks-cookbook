# Releasing

Releases are published to npm by GitHub Actions using npm **trusted publishing**
(OIDC). There is no npm token stored on this repository.

## One-time setup

Trusted publishing is configured from a package's settings page, so it cannot be
used for the very first publish of a package that does not exist yet. The first
release goes out from a workstation; everything after that goes out from CI.

### 1. Publish the first version manually

```bash
npm login --auth-type=web   # opens a browser, covers 2FA including passkeys
npm publish --access public # prepublishOnly reruns typecheck, tests and build
```

If the account requires two-factor authentication on writes and the second
factor is a security key rather than an authenticator app, the CLI cannot prompt
for it. Use a recovery code from the account's 2FA settings:
`npm publish --access public --otp=<recovery-code>`.

### 2. Register the trusted publisher

On npmjs.com, open the package, then **Settings** and the **Trusted Publisher**
section. Every field is case-sensitive and must match this repository exactly:

| Field                | Value                    |
| -------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Publisher            | GitHub Actions           |
| Organization or user | `smeet666`               |
| Repository           | `mcp-wikibooks-cookbook` |
| Workflow filename    | `publish.yml`            |
| Environment          | leave empty              |

### 3. Revoke anything used to bootstrap

Any token or recovery code used for the first publish should be revoked once
trusted publishing works, since it is no longer needed.

## Every release after that

1. Bump the version in **five** places, which must stay in step:
   - `package.json`
   - `package-lock.json`, whose root `version` field is easy to forget by hand
   - `server.json` (twice: the top-level `version` and each package `version`)
   - `packaging/manifest.json`, which names the version inside the `.mcpb`
   - `src/version.ts`, which feeds the User-Agent sent to Wikimedia

   `npm version patch --no-git-tag-version` covers the first two together, which
   is why it is preferred over editing `package.json` directly.

2. Update `CHANGELOG.md`.
3. Commit, then tag and push:

```bash
npm version patch --no-git-tag-version   # package.json + package-lock.json
# then edit server.json, packaging/manifest.json and src/version.ts to match
git commit -am "Release v1.0.1"
git tag v1.0.1
git push origin main --tags
```

The `publish.yml` workflow reruns typecheck, tests and build, then publishes
with `--provenance`, which links the published tarball to the exact commit and
workflow run that produced it. A second job builds the `.mcpb` bundle and
attaches it to the GitHub release.

## Verifying a release

```bash
npm view mcp-wikibooks-cookbook version
npx -y mcp-wikibooks-cookbook          # should start and wait on stdin
```

The npm package page should show a provenance badge pointing at the workflow
run.

Note that publishing is permanent: a version can only be unpublished within 72
hours, and the name stays reserved afterwards.

## Listing on the MCP registry

`server.json` at the repository root is ready for the official MCP registry.
`publish-registry.yml` runs after a successful npm publish, stamps the bundle's
SHA-256 into the `mcpb` package entry, and publishes the listing. It can also be
dispatched by hand to catch up a version whose registry entry was missed.

Publishing the listing from a workstation instead:

```bash
mcp-publisher login github -token "$(gh auth token)"
mcp-publisher publish
```

Ownership is proven by matching the `mcpName` field in `package.json` against
this repository.

## The live canary

`live-canary.yml` runs the live suite nightly at 07:34 UTC and opens an issue
when it fails. It matters here because the Cookbook is written by volunteers and
served through a gateway that is a public service rather than a versioned
product: a page can be restructured overnight, and the response shapes this
server reads can change without notice. The unit tests run on generated fixtures
that would stay green while the published server is broken for everyone.

The canary paces itself at three seconds between requests, wider than the
default, since a scheduled job has nobody waiting on it.
